    <p>
        Welcome to the <strong>Creative Commons Showcase</strong>!  
        This project demonstrates how to correctly use, attribute, and showcase
        Creative Commons–licensed content. The galleries feature images of 
        <em>Insects</em>, <em>Space</em>, and <em>People</em>, all shared under 
        open licenses.

        Creative Commons makes it easy for creators to share their work legally 
        while giving others permission to reuse it.  
        The aim of this site is educational — to help students, teachers, and 
        creatives explore open licensing.

        This site was built as part of a learning project using PHP, HTML, CSS, 
        and a sprinkle of JavaScript for interactivity.
