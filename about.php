  <h2>About Fashion Showcase</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome to the <strong>Fashion Showcase</strong>!  
    This site was created to inspire and educate by presenting a variety of fashion
    styles through curated galleries and background information. Our focus is on 
    three key trends shaping today’s culture: <em>Streetwear</em>, <em>Athleisure</em>, 
    and <em>Grunge</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each gallery highlights the history, cultural context, and aesthetics of its style.
    Whether it’s the bold urban influence of streetwear, the comfortable versatility of
    athleisure, or the raw edge of grunge, these styles represent more than clothing —
    they reflect identity, creativity, and community.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Fashion Showcase project was built using PHP for dynamic content, HTML and CSS 
    for structure and design, and JavaScript for interactivity. It’s designed as a 
    modern, student-friendly platform for exploring how fashion continues to influence 
    and connect people around the world.
