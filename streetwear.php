  Streetwear is a fashion movement that emerged from the streets of major cities in the late 1970s and 1980s, blending influences from skateboarding, hip-hop, surf culture, and graffiti art. It began in California, where surf brands like <em>Stüssy</em> popularized bold graphics and logo-centric designs, and simultaneously grew in New York alongside the rise of hip-hop crews who expressed their identity through oversized fits, sneakers, and statement accessories.

  In the 1990s, streetwear became global as skateboarding brands like <em>Supreme</em> and hip-hop fashion lines such as <em>FUBU</em> and <em>Sean John</em> pushed the culture into the mainstream. Sneakers became a central element of streetwear, with Nike Air Jordans and Adidas Superstars evolving from sports shoes into cultural icons.

  Today, streetwear continues to evolve, shaped by collaborations between luxury houses and streetwear labels (like <em>Louis Vuitton × Supreme</em>), as well as the influence of social media and global youth culture. It’s characterized by graphic tees, hoodies, baggy jeans, sneakers, and accessories that reflect individuality, rebellion, and creativity — always tied to its roots in music, art, and subculture.
