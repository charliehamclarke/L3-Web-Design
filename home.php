    <h2>Welcome to the Fashion Showcase</h2>

    <p>
        Fashion is more than just clothing — it’s a form of self-expression, culture, 
        and creativity. The <strong>Fashion Showcase</strong> celebrates iconic 
        styles and trends that have shaped the way people dress and define themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        Explore our galleries to discover three of today’s most influential fashion styles:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Streetwear</strong> – bold, urban, and rooted in skateboarding and hip-hop culture.</li>
        <li><strong>Athleisure</strong> – the modern blend of performance wear and everyday comfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Grunge</strong> – raw, edgy, and inspired by the 90s alternative music scene.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Each gallery highlights fashion photography, inspiration, and design ideas that 
        showcase how clothing can become a lifestyle. Whether it’s the relaxed fit of 
        athleisure, the layered textures of grunge, or the statement pieces in streetwear — 
        there’s a story behind every style.
